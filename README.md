# Introduction

This website is still under construction! I am an almost graduated PhD student, and I'd like to show off some of the projects I've worked on. They are a mix of academic work tied to my study of cells, and also other things that interest me (like tattoos). I hope you find them interesting! You can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-keeling/).

## Things I've done

- Finding cell nucleus from only CSK images
- Processing raw AFM data to generate stifness maps with UNET
- Generating synthetic cell images using Pix2Pix GAN
- Generating novel tattoos
